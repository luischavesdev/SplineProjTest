# Spline Projection Tests
<p align="justify">
Unreal Engine project that explores a couple of different approaches to project splines onto whatever may be below, be it a landscape or something else. Solutions mainly involve using meshes to render the projection, or by using decals, so if none of those are viable to your particular use case, you might be out of luck in here. Blueprints were used instead of C++ and the splines can be freely adjusted either in editor or in runtime, in case you were wondering.

## Build/Run Instructions

Project does not have any additional bells and whistles, so it should work straight out of the box. Just for reference though, Unreal Engine 5.3 was used.
